\chapter{Introduction} \label{introduction}

The APB4 GPIO Core is fully parameterised core designed to provide a user-defined number of general purpose, bidirectional IO to a design.

The IO are accessible via an \emph{AMBA APB v2.0 Specification} interface -- typically referred to as APB4 -- with the core operating synchronously at the rising edge of the APB4 Bus Clock..

GPIO I=inputs to the core may operate asynchronously to the core and will be automatically synchronised to the bus clock. Outputs may be configured to operate in push-pull mode or open-drain.

GPIO inputs may also be individually configured to generate a level or edge sensitive interrupt. A single IRQ output is provided to connect to the host.
